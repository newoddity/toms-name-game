## TODOs
Things that would have been awesome to do...
- GameData needs to be it`s own class.
 - This would isolate and organize the two levels of information (raw and populated) so that the code would be cleaner.
- Game state needs much better management. 
- Find a someone with visual imagination and crayons to make this look better.
- Add proper documentation so I do not hate past-me.
- Rethink the scoring system. Random tests with "Matt or Nott" weighs those questions astronomically more than the others.
- Rethink the tallying logic.
